- 👋 Hi, I’m @madcorgi
- 👀 I’m interested in software craftmanship.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to transform a legacy, ad-hoc development team into a highly production agile machine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have a purpose where people from all backgrounds are welcome -- and knowing someone's background is not important at all.
- 📫 How to reach me is yet to be decided.
